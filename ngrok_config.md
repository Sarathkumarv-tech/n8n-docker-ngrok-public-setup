# NGROK Configuration

## Steps to Authenticate NGROK:
1. **Create an NGROK Account**: 
   - Visit [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/) and create a free account.
2. **Obtain Your NGROK Authtoken**:
   - Go to the [NGROK Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started) and copy your **Authtoken**.
3. **Authenticate NGROK on Your Local Machine**:
   - Open your terminal and run the following command to authenticate NGROK:
   ```bash
   ngrok authtoken <your_ngrok_token>
Replace <your_ngrok_token> with your actual token from the NGROK dashboard.
Running the NGROK Tunnel:
Start the Tunnel:

After setting up the authtoken, start the NGROK tunnel by running the following command:

bash
Copy
ngrok http 5678
This command exposes your local N8N instance (running on port 5678) to the public internet through a secure HTTPS tunnel.

Access the Public URL:

Once the tunnel is established, you will see a public URL in the terminal like https://<your-ngrok-url>.ngrok.io.

This is the URL you can use to access your N8N instance remotely from any device.

Stopping the NGROK Tunnel:
To stop the NGROK tunnel, simply press Ctrl+C in the terminal where NGROK is running.

Security Considerations:
Ensure that you authenticate your NGROK account to avoid any interruptions or limits on tunnel usage.

Avoid sharing the NGROK URL publicly unless necessary, as it provides access to your local N8N instance.
